# AIM - To understand the basics of C++


# Theory:

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose 
programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented 
programming paradigms. It is widely used for system/software development
 due to its performance, efficiency, and flexibility. This experiment 
introduces two fundamental C++ programs: a "Hello World" display and a 
basic calculator.


# 1. Hello World Program:


The "Hello World" program is 
typically the first step in learning any programming language. Its 
purpose is to demonstrate how to display output on the screen and 
understand the foundational components of a C++ program.


Key theoretical aspects include:

 Header Files:
 These provide access to standard input-output functions. In this case, a
 standard library is included to enable console output.


 Main Function: 
  Every C++ program begins execution from the main() function. It acts as the entry point.


 Output Statement: 
A standard command is used to send text to the screen, allowing the program to display "Hello, World!" when run.


This simple program helps 
familiarize students with basic syntax, structure, and the process of 
compiling and executing a C++ file.


# 2. Simple Arithmetic Calculator:

The calculator program takes two numbers as input and then displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient, all in a single run.
Key Concepts:

    Variables: Used to store the two numbers entered by the user.

    Data Types: Typically, floating-point types are used to allow for decimal inputs and outputs.

    User Input: A standard input command is used to allow the user to enter two numbers.

    Arithmetic Operations: The four basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—are performed using arithmetic operators.

    Output Display: The results of each operation are displayed clearly, showing how the input numbers relate to each operation.

This version of the calculator is simpler and does not require conditional logic or operator selection from the user. Instead, it demonstrates how to process and display multiple results from a single pair of inputs.
